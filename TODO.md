# Pathfinding Visualization with 5-Second Node Delays - Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete:

### 1. Update AStarAlgo.js
- [x] Convert findPath() method to async
- [x] Add step-by-step processing with 5-second delays
- [x] Add callback mechanism for visualization updates
- [x] Implement delay between processing each node from open list

### 2. Update main.js
- [x] Update findPath() to handle async pathfinding
- [x] Add visual feedback for currently processing node
- [x] Add method to update visualization during pathfinding
- [x] Handle UI state during pathfinding process
- [x] Add reset functionality

### 3. Update styles.css
- [x] Add CSS classes for current node visualization
- [x] Add styles for processing states
- [x] Add animations for visited and current nodes

### 4. Testing
- [x] Test step-by-step visualization
- [x] Verify 5-second delay works correctly
- [x] Ensure final path displays correctly
- [x] Test reset functionality during processing

### 5. Additional Enhancements
- [x] Add logging for current node coordinates and f, g, h values
- [x] Restore 5-second delay duration (was accidentally set to 500ms)

## Current Status: Implementation Complete with Logging

## Changes Made:

### AStarAlgo.js:
- Added async/await support to findPath() method
- Added 5-second delay between processing each node
- Added visualization callback mechanism
- Added helper methods for delay and callback setup

### main.js:
- Updated PathfindingDemo class to handle async pathfinding
- Added visualization states tracking (currentProcessingNode, visitedNodes)
- Added updateVisualization() method for real-time updates
- Updated UI to show "Finding Path..." during processing
- Added proper reset functionality
- Updated event listeners to handle async operations

### styles.css:
- Added .visited class with yellow/orange gradient for processed nodes
- Added .current class with pink/yellow gradient for currently processing node
- Added animations: visitedFade and currentPulse
- Enhanced visual feedback with proper shadows and transitions

## How it works:
1. User clicks "Find Path" button
2. Algorithm starts processing nodes one by one
3. Each node being processed is highlighted with pink/yellow gradient and pulsing animation
4. Previously processed nodes are shown with yellow/orange gradient
5. 5-second delay between each node processing step
6. Final path is displayed in blue when complete
7. Button is disabled during processing and shows "Finding Path..." text
